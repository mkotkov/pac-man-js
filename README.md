We will create a game with:

- JavaScript 
- HTML

Without 

- any frameworks
- canvas 
- WebGL etc. 

Your game must be performant:
 - at 60FPS without dropping frames. 
 - game must implement a pause menu
 - show a countdown clock,
 - keep score
 - show remaining lives.
 
Controls must be smooth, so that a player is not required to repeatedly press a key to move smoothly. 
 
In this project, you will learn about requestAnimationFrame, the event loop, FPS, DOM, jank/stutter, transform, opacity and dev tools.
