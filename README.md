# Make Your Game

Welcome to the Make Your Game project! In this project, we will create a game using JavaScript and HTML, without relying on any frameworks, canvas, WebGL, etc.

## Requirements

- The game must be performant, running at a smooth 60 frames per second (FPS) without dropping frames.
- It should implement a pause menu for the player to pause the game.
- The game should display a countdown clock, keeping track of the remaining time.
- It should also keep score and display the remaining lives.

## Smooth Controls

The controls of the game should be smooth, allowing the player to move smoothly without the need to repeatedly press a key.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout this project, you will learn about various concepts and technologies, including:

- `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations.
- Understanding the event loop and how it affects the game's performance.
- Working with the DOM to update and manipulate game elements.
- Dealing with jank and stutter to ensure a smooth gameplay experience.
- Utilizing CSS properties like `transform` and `opacity` for visual effects.
- Using developer tools to debug and optimize the game.
