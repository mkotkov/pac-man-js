# Make Your Game
Welcome to the Make Your Game project! In this project, we will create a game using JavaScript and HTML, without relying on any frameworks, canvas, WebGL, etc.

## Guideline to run the application
To run the application, follow these steps:
  1. Clone this repository telling the computer `git clone https://01.kood.tech/git/mkotkov/make-your-game`.
  2. Install [the Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
  3. Right click or control+click on `index.html` and select `Open with Live Server`.
  4. The game will start in via the default browser, and you can pause the game by pressing the `space` bar.
  5. Enjoy our version of Pac-Man!
